**Date:** \
Thursday, June 12, 2025

**Time:** \
9:30am–12:30pm (morning session)

**Instructor:** \
Marie-Hélène Burle (Simon Fraser University)

**Prerequisites:** \
This session is a follow-up to the introduction to Git.

**Software:** \
We will provide access to one of our Linux systems. To make use of it, attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer. On Windows we recommend the [free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
