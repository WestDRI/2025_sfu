Each day we will have morning (9:30am - 12:30pm) and afternoon (1:30m - 4:30pm) sessions. <!-- There will be short -->
<!-- coffee breaks at 11:00am and 3:00pm with coffee and snacks covered by the registration fee. Participants will -->
<!-- have to find lunch on their own. -->

You can attend as many or as few of the courses as you want. All sessions will be in-person at the Big Data
Hub at SFU's main (Burnaby) campus, in the Applied Sciences Building (top floor).

To participate in the hands-on exercises, you will need to bring your own laptop. We will provide guest
accounts on our HPC training cluster. For more specific requirements, please see the individual course
pages. <br><br><br>
