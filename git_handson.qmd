title: Hands-on Git
description: |
  <br>
  In this hands-on session, you will collaborate on a project of your choice: Bash scripting, High-Performance
  Computing (HPC), or R programming. The session is designed to introduce practical collaboration techniques
  using GitHub.

  You will learn how to:

  1. set up SSH access to GitHub using a public-private key pair for secure authentication,
  1. collaborate with direct write access to a shared repository,
  1. contribute via pull requests (PRs) when you do not have write access.

  By the end of this session, you'll be able to confidently participate in or manage collaborative projects on
  GitHub, with a deeper understanding of workflows that suit different access levels.
