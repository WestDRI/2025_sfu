title: R optimizations
description: |
  <br>R is not a fast language. Poorly written R code is *really slow!*

  Faced with slow code, people tend to think "parallel" or "GPU" (which is an adjacent topic since GPUs allow to run many simple calculations in parallel). Parallel programming can indeed greatly help speed up some types of code. However not all programs can be parallelized, parallel programming has downsides and overheads, and—most importantly—before considering parallel programming, people should optimize their serial code.

  This course will cover just that: how to benchmark code, how to identify bottlenecks, how to greatly improve code performance without using additional hardware.

**Date:** \
Wednesday, June 11, 2025

**Time:** \
1:30pm–4:30pm (afternoon session)

**Location:** \
SFU's Big Data Hub Presentation Studio (ASB 10900)

**Instructor:** \
Marie-Hélène Burle

**Prerequisites:** \
Basic knowledge of R.

**Software:** \
We will provide access to one of our Linux systems. To make use of it, attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer. On Windows we recommend the [free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
